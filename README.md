# hackathon
Ideas, logistics and resources for planning hackathons at Memorial.


## Getting off the Ground: First Steps & Logistics:
1. Would be nice to have predominantly casual meetups to iron out bugs and get practice having codeathons/hackathons before attempting an advertised (as in posters around campus) or sponsored meetup. Big hackathons could have an entry fee to raise money for fundraising cost of equipment for the hackathon or charity. Hacking for charity is cool.
2. After we sort the logistics of running a small event, work on bigger hackathons, that can include any MUN student (ECE, etc) who is interested.

Misc:
1. Build a website! This is important for gaining sponsors.


## Hackathon: Kattis Challenges:
- Access to a projector would be nice so people can spectate if they're interested in attending to see what everything is about but aren't comfortable participating.
- https://open.kattis.com is a programming challenge site that ranks Universities across countries and states/provinces. MUN has a surprisingly high ranking on the leaderboard. Challenges are of any and all difficulties, and your profile on the site might make good CV padding.

## Hackathon: Major League Hackathon

This one looks like the real deal, and would take some hard work to get towards but is a great goal. 

## Hackathon: For Charity:
Something like the aptly named https://hackersforchartiy.org, or a locally planned hackathon with a charitable twist.

## Hackathon: Cyber-Security CTF
- Currently the best way to organize a security CTF seems using an RPi and an ethernet hub, BYO laptop and plug everyone in AdHoc style. This is because putting devices on the network at MUN and then being able to ping/nmap/ssh is shoddy at best.
- Many services exist with prebuilt vulnerable images that have corresponding walkthrough guides. These can be used to easily host challenges without creating them ourselves.
- [https://hackthebox.eu](https://hackthebox.eu) seems to be the Kattis 'equivalent' for the security world. Users can complete challenges to get points for their Country and University on their own time as well as compete against others.
